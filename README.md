# MC Backup Bat
A short little batch script for backing up Minecraft Java worlds.

## To use:
1. Run `mcbackup.bat` either by double clicking the batch script or by using Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
2. Type the world you want to backup exactly how you see it
3. The backed up Minecraft world will appear on your desktop for you to store elsewhere
   - The world will be in the format `[world]_[month][day][year][hour][minute].zip`
     - Example: `World_122320240915.zip`

## Enjoy!
