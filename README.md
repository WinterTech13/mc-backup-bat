# MC Backup Bat
A short batch script for backing up Minecraft Java and Bedrock worlds.

## To use:
1. Run `mcbackup.bat` either by double clicking the batch script or by using Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
2. Choose either option 1 (Java) or option 2 (Bedrock)
3. Type the world you want to backup exactly how you see it
4. The backed up Minecraft world will appear on your Desktop for you to store elsewhere
   - The world will be in the format `[world]_[month][day][year][hour][minute].zip`
     - Example: `World_122320240915.zip`

## Enjoy!
